The unprecedented orderbook put a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on container liner stocks.</p><p>But take another look from the perspective of the container lines&#8217; time horizon.</p><p>Container lines &#8211; several of which have explicit government ties or implicit government backstops &#8211; plan to be in business indefinitely. If the time horizon of their business plan requires them to order new fuel-efficient ships en masse to supplant older tonnage &#8211; even at the expense of years of overcapacity and depressed stock pricing &#8211; then so be it.</p><p>The best time for liner operators to renew their fleets is when they have ample cash, which, in the history of liner shipping, is a rare event.</p><p>Pre-COVID, liner companies suffered through a decade at or below breakeven.</p><p>There was a major bankruptcy (Hanjin) and liner losses were widespread. It was not a time for tonnage providers to obtain financing for new ships, for liners to back tonnage providers&#8217; orders with long-term charters, or for liners to order new ships themselves.</p><p>As a consequence, the global container shipping fleet was ageing and increasingly inefficient going into the pandemic.</p><p>Liners then suddenly found themselves wallowing in mammoth piles of cash, courtesy of the COVID boom. They ordered a record number of new ships and diversified into other businesses (and had so much left over that they also paid out historically high dividends and were still able to retain huge cash cushions for the downcycle).</p><p>The new container ships that liner execs ordered during the boom, which are being delivered now, are reportedly up to 40% more fuel-efficient than the vessels ordered prior to 2010. Many are also dual-fuel-capable, &#8220;future proofing&#8221; against yet-to-be-written environmental regs.</p><p>Container lines have been widely characterized as being irresponsible for ordering so many ships, but what is irresponsible &#8211; from a multi-decade time-horizon perspective &#8211; about renewing fleets that needed to be renewed at one of the few times historically that it has been financially attractive to do so?</p><p>Liners can hand back their older leased ships to tonnage providers and scrap the older ships they own to make room for the new vessels. The total of older leased capacity and scrappable owned capacity exceeds the new capacity on order.</p><p>It will not be a smooth transition. Lease maturities are not aligned with newbuild deliveries and some shipping lines will invariably compete for market share. Liners will take a financial beating &#8211; and liner execs almost certainly knew this when they signed all those newbuild contracts. They&#8217;ll give back some (possibly a lot) of the cash reserves they still have left over from the pandemic bonanza. They&#8217;ll be mocked for bringing financial pain upon themselves.</p><p>But when the dust finally settles, liner operators will still be in business and will boast fleets of modern, fuel-efficient ships that will serve them for two decades to come, courtesy of their surprise windfall from the COVID boom. And that was the plan.</p><h3><strong>Time horizons for commodity shipping</strong></h3><p>Bulk commodity shipping owners, like liner operators, think long term. In many cases, they are multigenerational family owners who are willing to make decisions that pressure stocks and investor payouts today in order to lay the groundwork for the next generation&#8217;s business. (Even managers of non-family owners think in long-term, through-cycle terms.)</p><p>Investors have criticized some public shipping companies for insufficiently generous dividends and/or buybacks, for ordering expensive newbuildings, for keeping too much cash on the balance sheet, and for suddenly diversifying into entirely new shipping segments (or non-shipping businesses). The latest targets of investor chagrin are cash-rich, low-debt tanker owners like Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK).</p><p>But what upsets equity investors may make perfect sense for founding shipowners with long time horizons, in the same way the container-ship ordering spree looks irresponsible from one angle and arguably understandable from another.</p><p>Commodity shipping owners, like liner operators, must renew their fleets over time, and unlike liner operators, commodity shipping owners are &#8220;buy low, sell high&#8221; cycle timers when it comes to asset plays.</p><p>Thus, they not only need to use cash for fleet renewal and to weather the next downturn (as is the case with liner operators), they may also opt to hoard cash to buy distressed assets when the market slumps.</p><p>&#8220;At some point &#8211; and nobody wants to talk about this now &#8211; but at some point, we&#8217;re going to go off a cliff, and you want to have a whole lot of money to buy all the distressed assets you can at the right time,&#8221; said Stifel analyst Ben Nolan at the Capital Link International Shipping Forum in New York on March 11.</p><p>Meanwhile, returning too much capital to shareholders at cyclical highs has a dismal track record in shipping.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already lived through the full-payout model and it doesn&#8217;t work in shipping, given the volatility of rates and the need to use capital for other reasons, such as refreshing the fleet over time,&#8221; said Bank of America Managing Director Ken Hoexter at the Capital Link forum.</p><p>&#8220;The full-payout model is the end of the company,&#8221; Hoexter maintained.</p><p>The modus operandi of through-cycle commodity shipping owners is: Do not end the company. Stay alive through the downcycles so you are still there to take advantage of the next upcycle, because it could be &#8220;the big one.&#8221;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3><strong>&#8216;Responsible&#8217; is not rewarded</strong></h3><p>&#8220;Capital allocation is a bit of a lightning-rod topic in the world of commodity shipping,&#8221; explained Chappell in his research note.</p><p>&#8220;On one hand, there is a view that the [up] cycles are so short &#8230; that the only way an investor can be fully compensated for timing a cycle correctly is to be paid generously through dividends or buybacks while the cash inflows are robust.&#8221;</p><p>The counterargument is that &#8220;if cycles are so short, and downturns are usually much longer in duration, upturns should be periods of cash harvest so that no new funds are needed to endure the next downturn and, more importantly, management teams can nimbly invest in new assets at the trough.</p><p>&#8220;Many owners would consider the latter the &#8216;right&#8217; or &#8216;responsible&#8217; path given the inherent volatility of shipping, with the returns over many cycles from this strategy likely to be superior when ships can be acquired at the bottom with cash.&#8221;</p><p>Alas, shipping stock investors &#8220;historically afford much larger multiples to the equities of those companies that reward them with lofty dividends through the upturns,&#8221; wrote Chappell.</p><p>&#8220;&#8217;Responsible&#8217; is not rewarded.&#8221;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Liner execs downplay Red Sea upside, punishing their own shares]]></title><description><![CDATA[Also in this issue: Panama Canal transits fell, yet again, in February]]></description><link>https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/liner-execs-downplay-red-sea-upside</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/liner-execs-downplay-red-sea-upside</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Greg Miller]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 22:50:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg" width="1456" height="816" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:816,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5457931,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F860530c8-1d36-4125-b2bb-9c636965b19d_4800x2689.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(Photo: Zim)</figcaption></figure></div><p>The bull case for container line stocks:</p><p>Disruptions at the Panama Canal and in the Red Sea dramatically increase voyage distances, offsetting newbuilding capacity additions. Disruptions are long-lasting, keeping extended voyage distances in place throughout this year, if not longer.</p><p>Spot rates remain elevated and surcharges boost liner contract revenues. Elevated spot rates push up the next round of trans-Pacific contract rates, which will be negotiated over the next two and a half months. Higher annual trans-Pacific rates bolster liner revenues for contract terms running from May 1, 2024, to April 30, 2025.</p><p>This upside is not yet reflected in liner stock prices, but it will be eventually.</p><p>The bear case for container line stocks:</p><p>Regardless of how long Panama Canal and Red Sea disruptions last, the impact on spot rates is temporary because networks adjust. Liners have plenty of extra vessel capacity to handle the longer routes, with more new ships delivered every week. Spot rates have already fallen back materially in the Asia-Europe trade and will follow suit in the Asia-U.S. trade.</p><p>As the onslaught of newbuilding capacity continues, spot rates will ultimately slump back to pre-disruption levels.</p><p>U.S. importers will &#8220;slow-walk&#8221; trans-Pacific contract negotiations this year and wait for spot rates to fall further. Even if spot rates don&#8217;t fall all the way back to pre-disruption levels by the time the new annual contracts are signed, importers won&#8217;t agree to significantly elevated contracts rates through April 30, 2025, because they will assume spot rates will be much lower at the back end of this annual period.</p><p>The reprieve that Panama Canal and Red Sea disruptions gave to shipping lines doesn&#8217;t change their eventual fate: Average rates (including contract and spot) will be below breakeven for an extended period at some point in the future, eating away at the cash cushions shipping lines amassed during the boom and preventing public shipping lines from paying dividends.</p><p>Stocks price in this future downside and give little weight to transitory, disruption-induced upside.</p><p>The container shipping lines themselves, much to the dismay of retail stock traders, have done little to support the bull case and have instead talked up the bear case.</p><p><a href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply">First came the warning-filled Maersk call on Feb. 8</a>, which caused Maersk&#8217;s shares to sink 15%.

(Zim does not guide on net income, which is often lower than EBIT.)</p><p>During the conference call, Zim executives spent more time focusing on the downside scenario and on managing investor expectations lower.</p><p>&#8220;There is a fundamental difference between the current disruptions and the prevailing market conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said Zim CEO Eli Glickman. &#8220;The COVID-era market was characterized by a significant increase in consumer demand accompanied by unprecedented supply chain disruptions. Current market conditions, on the other hand, are primarily supply-driven.&#8221;</p><p>That said, there is a demand factor in play. Zim CFO Xavier Destriau noted that spot rates appear to have peaked in January, coinciding with a temporary demand situation: &#8220;the seasonal cargo rush prior to Chinese New Year.&#8221; Going forward, he said, &#8220;Strong demand could potentially keep rates higher, but if demand is weak as shippers remain cautious on inventory levels, rates could continue to slide down.&#8221;</p><p>On the more important supply side, Zim executives highlighted the timing of the resolution of the Red Sea conflict and its impact on effective fleet capacity. While Destriau acknowledged that &#8220;there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a military or political resolution of the crisis in sight,&#8221; he warned that &#8220;this could change quickly.&#8221; If there is a resolution, &#8220;the rate adjustment might be quite severe and quite rapid.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We think there is a scenario where rates might go back, clearly, to where they were in October-November 2023.&#8221; (Rates at that time were well below breakeven for liners.)</p><p>Even in the more likely scenario of Red Sea diversions persisting for an extended period, Destriau cautioned that &#8220;new capacity will put additional pressure on the market&#8221; and &#8220;all the vessels coming into the trades between now and the end of the year &#8211; even if the Red Sea situation was to last for longer &#8211; will put pressure on the supply-demand equilibrium.&#8221;</p><p>He estimated that Red Sea diversions absorbed 6-7% of global capacity, whereas newbuildings will add 10% to global capacity this year (unmentioned was that there&#8217;s a lot more newbuilding capacity to come in 2025). </p><p>Furthermore, Destriau noted that shipping lines have &#8220;sidelined&#8221; capacity management measures such as slow steaming, ship idling and blank sailings, and 2024 scrapping is currently predicted to be minimal, at below 2% of global capacity.</p><p>The net result is that Zim expects disruptions to translate into better results in Q1 2024 than in Q4 2023, although that&#8217;s not saying much: Zim reported a net loss of $147 million in Q4 2023. Destriau said that disruptions could &#8220;potentially&#8221; benefit Q2 2024 results, and that &#8220;the second half is expected to be weaker than the first half.&#8221;</p><p>&nbsp;As for average rates in 2024, Zim expects them to be only &#8220;slightly&#8221; better than in 2023, even with the early gains already in the books.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Panama Canal transits still falling &#8211; but no supply chain crisis in sight</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg" width="1456" height="693" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:693,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6515581,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae333fd-98d6-4b57-b34f-8578d1ae9338_4800x2284.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(Photo: ACP)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Newly released data from the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) shows that the total number of transits through the drought-stricken waterway fell yet again in February.

There is a belief that, for whatever reason, shipping stocks fare poorly on Mondays.</p><p>This theory is not unique to shipping stocks. The idea that stocks, in general, do worse on Mondays than Fridays dates back to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4529641">a 1973 study by academic Frank Cross</a>, if not earlier. Other studies have disputed this theory.</p><p>What does the trading data show for shipping stocks?</p><p>Inside Shipping calculated the average price changes by day of the week for 24 of the most highly traded U.S.-listed shipping stocks, based on the change in adjusted closing price versus the prior close over a one-year period from March 3, 2023, to March 4, 2024.</p><p>The result: Over the past year, for whatever reason, average daily returns on shipping stocks have indeed been worse on Mondays than any other day of the week, and significantly worse than on Fridays.</p><p>The average daily change in the 24 shipping equities (not weighted by market cap) was -0.15% on Mondays, versus a gain of 0.6% on Fridays. Average price changes were -0.05% on Tuesdays and flat on Wednesdays and Thursdays.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the five single trading sessions during the one-year period with the highest average gains, four landed on a Friday. The biggest takeaway from the past year&#8217;s trading data is Friday&#8217;s strength more so than Monday&#8217;s weakness.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg" width="1456" height="555" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:493231,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f11bf66-0602-4433-a391-724af94c154f_4800x1830.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Average daily moves of 24 shipping stocks calculated by Inside Shipping based on data from Yahoo Finance for: tanker owners Frontline, DHT, INSW, Teekay Tankers, NAT, Scorpio, Ardmore, Torm, OSG and TEN; dry bulk owners Genco, Golden Ocean, Star Bulk and Safe Bulkers; container liner operators Zim and Matson; container-ship lessor GSL; mixed-fleet owners Danaos, Costamare, Navios Partners and CPLP; LNG carrier owner Flex LNG; and LPG carrier owners Dorian and Navigator Gas.</em></figcaption></figure></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading INSIDE SHIPPING!

They entice with the promise of outsized returns, then maddeningly refuse to follow the script. Shipping rates are inherently volatile &#8211; they don&#8217;t go up or down in a straight line &#8211; and the stocks can slide for months at a time when the fundamentals say they shouldn&#8217;t. Or they can jump when they&#8217;re not expected to.</p><p>Just over two months into 2024, dry bulk, container and tanker stock moves are showing, yet again, how difficult they are to predict.</p><h3><strong>Dry bulk stocks</strong></h3><p>Larger bulk commodity vessels are known for sudden swings in spot rates. Case in point: what&#8217;s happening now with Capesizes, larger dry bulk vessels with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons that carry iron ore, coal, and &#8211; increasingly &#8211; bauxite.</p><p>The first quarter is notoriously terrible for Capesizes due to weather constraints on iron ore loadings in Brazil and Australia. In mid-February 2023, Capesize rates sank to a nadir of $2,200 per day, according to Clarksons data. The average breakeven at the time was $15,000 per day &#8211; Capesize owners were bleeding cash.</p><p>What a difference a year makes. Clarksons put average spot rates on March 4 at $34,900 per day, up 107% month on month and 59% above the current breakeven (they&#8217;ve since pulled back to $31,300 per day). Rates for midsize Panamax and Supramax bulkers are unexceptional; Panamaxes are at their five-average, Supramaxes slightly below their five-year average.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg" width="1456" height="581" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:581,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:963877,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1c6aa31-3f87-4839-8ba3-7a4cd344275a_4800x1914.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Rate data through March 1.

In the past, the Atlantic Basin Capesize market was overwhelmingly driven by Brazil-to-China iron ore loads. Now, Guinea-to-China bauxite shipments are playing an increasingly role.</p><p>Bauxite exports from Guinea &#8220;have become a new structural trade in the Capesize segment,&#8221; said Lars-Christian Svensen, CEO of Golden Ocean (NASDAQ: GOGL), during a Feb. 28 conference call. The bauxite trade is also &#8220;inversely seasonal,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The bauxite high season is in Q1, whereas Brazil [iron ore exports] traditionally enter a slow season in the same quarter. This year, due to dry weather in Brazil, we have seen both export routes active in large volumes.&#8221;</p><p>Dry bulk shipping stocks have had their ups and downs over recent years. They soared during COVID (2021 through mid-2022) as pandemic restrictions at Chinese discharge ports tied up bulker capacity. They languished last year after Chinese congestion cleared, releasing vessel capacity into the market.</p><p>Year to date, dry bulk stocks, particularly those with Capesize exposure, have performed better than equities in other shipping segments.</p><p>Shipowners with fleets heavy on Capesizes, like Golden Ocean, top the performance list.

Asia-Europe contracts generally reset on Jan. 1, Asia-U.S. contracts on May 1. The Red Sea spot rate spike came too late to materially increase 2024 Asia-Europe contract rates, which had already been negotiated based on spot levels prior to Red Sea upside, <a href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply">according to Maersk</a>.</p><p>However, the continued strength of spot rates is perfectly timed to boost 2024 Asia-U.S. contract rates. Those negotiations typically being during the TPM Conference, held this year on March 4-6.</p><p>The irony of the Red Sea attacks is that Houthi rebels were specifically trying to punish Israeli interests, and called out Israeli liner company Zim (NYSE: ZIM) by name &#8211; and they have done the opposite.</p><p>Zim&#8217;s trans-Pacific business is heavily focused on the Asia-East Coast lane. The Houthi attacks have pushed up spot rates in this lane just in time for Zim to negotiate higher annual contract rates, which should allow Zim to limit its predicted losses, or, according to at least one analyst (Jefferies&#8217; Omar Nokta), turn a profit.</p><p>North Asia-East Coast spot rates were $5,500 per forty-foot equivalent unit (FEU) on March 5, 2.4 times levels on Dec. 1, prior to the Red Sea effect, according to Platts data. Southeast Asia-East Coast rates were assessed at $5,000 per FEU, 2.3 times Dec. 1 levels.</p><p>Liner stocks posted big gains in December due to Red Sea disruptions, however, that pricing support has faded even as spot freight rates have lingered at higher levels. Zim&#8217;s stock has given back much of its earlier gain, falling steadily since late January. As of March 5, it was only up 9% year to date, according to data from Kofyin (highlighting the extent of the recent pullback, it was still up 42% from Dec. 1 levels).</p><p>Other liner stocks are now down year to date, with Maersk faring worst, down 24%. Maersk&#8217;s stock sank following the company&#8217;s Feb. 8 conference call, when executives played down Red Sea upside and <a href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply">predicted a slump back to pre-attacks rate levels by year-end</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg" width="1456" height="469" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:469,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:774848,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63845dea-4a01-4192-b69d-abb4c8be657e_4800x1546.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Stock prices adjusted to account for dividends.

These companies own container ships and lease them to liners, with revenues driven by charter rates.</p><p>Charter rates were expected to fall this year as liners took delivery of newbuildings and let their legacy charters expire. Instead, largely courtesy of the Houthis, charter rates have risen.</p><p>According to Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL), charter rates for container ships with capacity of 6,500-6,840 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) averaged $27,000/day in February, up 4% from September; charter rates for 5,500- to 6,100-TEU ships averaged $25,000/day, up 4%; and rates for 4,000- to 5,470-TEU ships averaged $20,500/day, up 14%.</p><p>&#8220;Demand for large tonnage, including vintage units, is showing no sign of easing, which remains astonishing considering the continued influx of energy-efficient newbuilding vessels,&#8221; said Alphaliner in a March 5 report.</p><p>&#8220;The threat that newbuilding tonnage would destabilize the market has for now gone away, with the Red Sea problem greatly helping to absorb the new capacity,&#8221; Alphaliner continued. &#8220;Considering the ongoing shortage of prompt ships across the board and continued disruptions in the Red Sea, the short-term market outlook remains bright for NOOs.&#8221;</p><p>That said, U.S.-listed NOOs already had a high degree of their 2024 business locked in prior to the Red Sea-driven rate rise, courtesy of long-term charters inked during the supply chain crisis and in its immediate aftermath. Assuming disruption effects on charter rates are temporary, U.S.-listed NOOs have a limited opportunity to take advantage of the surprise strength.</p><p>Prior to the Red Sea attacks and heightened Panama Canal restrictions, Danaos (NYSE: DAC) had 90% of its capacity locked up on charters for this year, with Costamare (NYSE: CMRE) at 87%, GSL at 82% and Euroseas (NASDAQ: ESEA) at 70%.</p><p>With the exception of microcap Euroseas &#8211; which had the most exposure to disruption upside &#8211; stocks of container-ship lessors have seen only minimal gains, if any, due to the Red Sea and Panama Canal disruptions, likely due to their already locked-in charter coverage.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg" width="1456" height="477" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:477,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:827984,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F264ce835-942d-4598-acae-2ca40b5d9d36_4800x1573.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Stock prices adjusted to account for dividends.

However, tanker spot rates are inherently volatile and they have not had a strong start in 2024.</p><p>Spot rate data from Clarksons shows that rates for midsize Suezmax crude tankers and smaller Aframax crude tankers have been on the decline since early January. They are now near their five-year average and well below rates at this time last year.</p><p>Spot rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs) are faring better. VLCC rates have jumped in recent days, to $53,800 per day as of March 6 (for older, non-eco VLCCs). However, this is in line with the five-year average and 16% below VLCC rates at the same time last year, and brokerage Fearnleys reported on March 6 that &#8220;the upward charge is running out of steam.&#8221;</p><p>On the product tanker front, rates for non-eco LR1s and LR2s (larger vessels doing long-haul runs) have been falling since mid-January and are now down 30% and 35% year on year, respectively, according to Clarksons data.</p><p>MR (medium range) product tankers are outperforming, earning more per day than larger LR1s and LR2s that carry considerably more cargo. MR rates have risen year to date, and averaged $40,600 per day (for non-eco MRs) as of March 6, up 48% year on year.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg" width="1456" height="595" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:595,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:973147,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c69c02d-788b-417d-9d23-39b5add78944_4800x1961.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Rate data through March 1.

trade has been transformed in the two years since Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Whenever ocean trade faces an obstacle &#8211; an import ban, a price cap, a canal constraint &#8211; it reroutes around that obstacle. Cargo volumes continue to flow, like water drawn by gravity around a stone.</p><p>And whenever trade reflows due to a major event like Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, there are inevitably winners and losers (in shipping, usually winners).</p><p>Here&#8217;s an overview of how the war has impacted crude tanker trades, including the latest data on seaborne volumes from Kpler and the latest data on Russian crude pricing and Russian freight premiums from Argus:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3><strong>US exports buoyed by European demand</strong></h3><p>U.S. crude exports are squarely in the &#8220;winner&#8221; column, enjoying heightened demand from Europe as U.S. production has increased. America has surpassed Russia to become the world&#8217;s second-largest crude exporter, after Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The EU was heavily dependent on short-haul crude imports from neighboring Russia prior to the war. Since the EU ban on Russian crude in December 2022, replacement supplies have come to Europe from both the Middle East and the U.S.</p><p>Data from commodity intelligence provider Kpler shows February U.S. seaborne crude exports (through Feb. 23) averaging 4.47 million barrels per day (b/d). If the pace persists through the end of February, it would be the highest monthly average on record.</p><p>U.S. crude exports to Europe have now edged higher than exports to Asia. Kpler data shows that European imports of U.S. crude rose by 350,000 b/d in 2023 versus 2022, with Asian imports rising 220,000 b/d. Prior to the Russia-Ukraine war, U.S. crude exports to Asia handily surpassed those to Europe.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg" width="1456" height="597" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:597,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1219664,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4331b83-bcc8-4b61-ab3e-ded4d2cc1e31_4800x1968.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">February 2023 average is through Feb. 23.

This data clearly shows that the sanctions premium jumps when Urals exceeds the price cap and transport shifts from mainstream owners to the dark fleet.</p><p>A few examples:</p><p>Argus calculated that freight on a 140,000-ton cargo of Urals crude shipped aboard a mid-sized Suezmax tanker from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk to the west coast of India was $8.37 per barrel during the week ending Feb. 23. That was triple the baseline (non-Russian cargo) assessment $2.78 per barrel, equating to a whopping sanctions premium earned by dark fleet owners of 201%.</p><div

sanctions screws by the U.S. start to curtail Russian export volumes by reducing interest among Russia&#8217;s buyers, particularly in India?</p><p>On Feb. 23, the U.S. made its biggest sanctions move to date, putting Russian tanker company Sovcomflot and its 14 crude tankers on the &#8220;blocked&#8221; list.</p><p>According to Argus, Sovcomflot tankers have delivered 74 cargoes of Russian crude to India since January 2023, with Sovcomflot-transported cargoes accounting for 7.7% of India&#8217;s crude imports from Russia last year. India&#8217;s oil secretary, Pankaj Jain, stated earlier this month that India will not accept cargoes loaded on sanctioned vessels, reported Argus.</p><p>If sanctions tighten and force India to limit future purchases from Russia, India would presumably replace those volumes using non-Russian sources, increasing demand for mainstream tankers.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

the elephant in the room for supply chains: the severely strained ties between the U.S. and China and how the U.S. presidential election could worsen those relations.</p><p>For perspective on this issue &#8211; and how the more volatile geopolitical landscape impacts supply chains in general &#8211; Inside Shipping spoke in-depth with Paul Bingham, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&#8217;s director of transportation consulting, a highly regarded expert on U.S. trade flows.</p><p>The big takeaway: The supply chain crisis may be long gone, but this is definitely no time for complacency. Importers face &#8220;enormous risks from disruptions,&#8221; he warned.</p><h3>US presidential election and future tariff risk</h3><p><strong>INSIDE SHIPPING: After Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, tariffs impacted ocean volumes from China, as well as freight rates. The market was stronger in 2018 as U.S. importers rushed to beat the tariff deadline, then weaker in 2019 due to the inventory hangover from pulled-forward cargo. Trump is now leading in the polls, and talking about a 60%-plus tariff on imports from China. Could this lead to a pre-emptive pull-forward of imports even before the election?</strong></p><p>BINGHAM: &#8220;I think this is already in the discussion. You don&#8217;t need to wait until November, let alone 2025, to have some of the supply chain management folks say: &#8216;OK, we&#8217;ve learned our lesson. If this is going to happen, what&#8217;s our Plan B?&#8217;</p><p>&#8220;Once you&#8217;re convinced the probability is fairly high and you&#8217;ve looked at the cost implications of building inventory early, you may say: &#8216;Let&#8217;s pull forward.&#8217; Because you&#8217;ve lived through this before. This is not one of those situations of &#8216;it&#8217;s a politician just saying something in the campaign.&#8217; This is a case &#8211; unusually &#8211; where you have the credibility to say: &#8216;This is not an idle threat. He has been in office before and it happened before.&#8217;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t wait until the January 2025 inauguration and for executive orders to start to flow. You&#8217;d start to prep as soon as you could and take whatever actions you need to in advance.</p><p>&#8220;Because if you suddenly face accelerated, expanded, broad-scale import tariffs, that&#8217;s going to be at the top of your risk-management list. Some politicians may characterize tariffs differently, but there&#8217;s no getting around the fact that a tariff is fundamentally a tax on imports, and the one who&#8217;s hit first is the one who&#8217;s paying the tariff, which is the importer.&#8221;</p><p><strong>So, you think this could actually be a positive for peak season volumes this year, as importers pull forward cargoes ahead of a threatened 2025 tariff?</strong></p><p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>US supply chains remain heavily exposed to China</h3><p><strong>Despite the tariffs enacted by Trump &#8211; and kept in place by Joe Biden &#8211; U.S. containerized imports from China remain very high. They peaked during COVID and they&#8217;re up again recently. This January, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/gmjournalist/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply?r=9hzca&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Chinese imports accounted for 39.8% of total U.S. containerized imports</a>, according to Descartes &#8211; the highest proportion since September 2022, at the peak of the COVID boom.</strong></p><p><strong>So, U.S. supply chain exposure to China is extremely high. And in addition to the threat of incremental tariffs in the case of a Trump win, we&#8217;ve had military exercises by China off Taiwan since 2022, China aligning with Russia on the Russia-Ukraine war, and increased trade tensions with China involving the EV market.</strong></p><p><strong>Clearly, there&#8217;s more pressure than ever on U.S. importers to diversify supply chains away from China. Are you seeing progress on diversification?</strong></p><p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. But there is a lot of momentum, and even if Trump doesn&#8217;t win and we don&#8217;t see incremental tariffs, you&#8217;ll still see more supply chain diversification over time, despite increased capital costs and pressure from inflation and other negatives pushing back against that. Look at Mexico: We&#8217;ve seen growth in Mexico-U.S. trade to the point where Mexico has risen to be the number-one U.S. trading partner.&#8221;</p><p><strong>The concern is that there&#8217;s still so far to go with diversification of China trade, the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan remains, and that event could happen before enough diversification progress is made. It&#8217;s hard to even imagine what the supply chain effect of such a conflict would be.</strong></p><p>&#8220;Right. We don&#8217;t know how things could permute out of the South China Sea. There&#8217;s a lot of talk right now about what happens in the Middle East: Does it permute into a broader conflict in the region? &nbsp;How can the U.S. bear the load if it&#8217;s already strained from Ukraine and Russia and that expands into the Middle East and then into Asia? There&#8217;s speculation that this actually adds to the odds of something happening in Asia, because the leadership of some Asian countries may think the U.S. has a more limited ability to deal with something in Asia if it is already tied up in both Eastern Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>&#8220;I think it just adds to the overall level of geopolitical risk that flows down to supply chain managers and adds to pressure from investors who say: &#8216;OK, what&#8217;s your risk plan? Show me that your company is resilient.&#8217;&#8221;</p><h3>Setback for globalization</h3><p><strong>Looking at the overall geopolitical picture and how it relates to trade and ocean shipping, there seems to be a real change. For the first two decades of this century, the countries of the world played nice with each other and economies benefited from globalization. Now the world seems to be bifurcating, with trade splitting between various blocs.</strong></p><p><strong>From an Economics 101 perspective, the benefit of globalization is that countries produce the products they&#8217;re best suited to produce, through their comparative advantage, and consumers benefit from reduced costs. Doesn&#8217;t this mean that a material pullback from globalization is inflationary?</strong></p><p>&#8220;The big-picture story is: Yes, if you reverse globalization and you have Balkanization or regionalization of trade, that in theory is inflationary. You have fewer gains from trade because you are not taking advantage of the potential comparative advantages that you could collectively enjoy if you had truly globalized trade.</p><p>&#8220;But the devil&#8217;s in the details, because it all depends on source supply and who&#8217;s participating in regional trade groups and how this affects each market. For example, I don&#8217;t think the U.S. market is that affected if we don&#8217;t trade with Russia anymore, or if we don&#8217;t trade with some other countries that join regional groups besides the North Koreas of the world. So, the top-level impact would be inflationary, but the real answer is more complex.&#8221;</p><p><strong>I also wonder if the big-picture inflationary effect of deglobalization may be offset by counterbalancing deflationary effects, such as, for example, lower demand growth. If you look at bulk commodity shipping, tankers are sailing much longer distances due to geopolitical issues, and that&#8217;s supporting higher freight rates, but the price of oil is down from its highs and is around where it was at this time in 2018, despite wars in Europe and the Middle East. Energy consumers are not currently feeling the effect of higher tanker rates and inefficient shipping routes. In the same way, perhaps future goods consumers wouldn&#8217;t necessarily feel the effect of reduced globalization if prices were pushed down for other reasons.</strong></p><p>&#8220;Right, it may be muted by deflationary forces that offset some of the inflationary pressure that would come from deoptimized world trade from the perspective of lower comparative advantage.&#8221;</p><h3><strong>Demise of &#8216;just in time&#8217; supply chains</strong></h3><p><strong>With all these disruptions &#8211; not just geopolitical unrest but also the drought in Panama and the risk of a dockworker strike later this year at East and Gulf Coast ports &#8211; U.S. importers should really be investing in risk management.</strong></p><p><strong>But have importers learned their lesson from COVID? I wonder to what extent they will still essentially roll the dice, given the cost of making supply chain changes, how that affects the KPIs of current management, and the fact that it takes time for those changes to pay off. Maybe they don&#8217;t want to take that cost on their watch? An analogy from the public sector: Education is such an obvious investment, but there&#8217;s underinvestment in education because the payoff doesn&#8217;t come during current elected officials&#8217; time in office.</strong></p><p>&#8220;That tension [between management of future risk and near-term cost] exists up to the CEO level in many of the manufacturing and retail companies that struggle with that balance. It ebbs and flows over time, even within the same organization.</p><p>&#8220;But I think retailers and wholesalers and others now face enormous risks from disruptions. They need to incur a higher inventory carrying cost as an insurance policy. They cannot go back to the pure, lean &#8216;just in time&#8217; supply chain model from years ago because the repercussions from disruptions are just so huge. Companies have to have more of a buffer, and incur higher inventory carrying costs.</p><p>&#8220;I think there is going to be an acceptance of or bias toward the safety stock concept. The &#8216;just in case&#8217; approach is going to be something that is tolerated by CFOs and CEOs even though they face higher costs by doing so.</p><p>&#8220;What happened during COVID cost companies enormously. In some cases, it was so bad that it damaged brand value. And OK, COVID&#8217;s gone and the impact on the supply chain is gone, but now we&#8217;ve got the Red Sea and the Panama Canal and who knows what will happen in the South China Sea, and supply chain managers have to manage against those risks. You never want to get to the point where you&#8217;re suddenly scrambling for air charters to keep your factories running or to avoid stockouts that cripple your stores.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Does that mean the ultra-lean &#8216;just in time&#8217; supply chain model never comes back?</strong></p><p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t imagine anybody pushing that. I think the idealized world of supply chain management &#8211; where you have infinitely globalized supply chains and you&#8217;re purely chasing the lowest landed cost &#8211; is gone. Not only because of COVID but also because of this succession of disruptions since COVID.&#8221;</p><p><strong>It would require the world to cooperate. And it seems we&#8217;ve crossed a threshold where the countries of the world are not going to settle back into peaceful coexistence and disruption-free trade anytime soon.</strong></p><p>&#8220;The consensus that existed almost all the way up to the pandemic is gone. Managing supply chains is going to be more complex. You inherently have to cope with more scenario planning around risks. I just can&#8217;t see us getting back to a world where you discount away all the disruptions.&#8221;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[As US military polices Red Sea, US trade is nowhere in sight – it all diverted]]></title><description><![CDATA[U.S. import and export cargoes &#8211; from containers to gas to grains &#8211; are all going around the Cape of Good Hope.

The disruptions required more fleet capacity, and that capacity happened to be available, or on the way.</p><p>The next vessel segments to exit the Red Sea were liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers.</p><p>Prior to the Houthi attacks, high-capacity LPG tankers known as very large gas carriers (VLGCs) <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/gmjournalist/p/panama-canal-added-more-reservations?r=9hzca&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">had diverted from the drought-constrained Panama Canal</a> to the Suez Canal route. VLGCs on the U.S.-Asia run are now rounding the Cape instead of using the Suez.</p><h4><strong>Product carrier shift in full swing</strong></h4><p>The next mass detour to the Cape has involved product carriers &#8211; the specialized tankers that transport refined products such as diesel, gasoline and jet fuel.</p><p>As of Feb. 16, vessel-position data confirmed that product tanker traffic in the southern Red Sea had slowed to a trickle, with most Asia-Europe and Mideast-Europe flows going around the Cape. (There continue to be product tankers in the Northern Red Sea, loading at Saudi Arabian refineries for cargoes headed northbound via the Suez.)</p><p>According to data presented by Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG) during a quarterly call on Feb. 14, refined product flows transiting the Suez plunged from 2.2 million barrels per day in December to 800,000 barrels per day in January to just 200,000 barrels per day in the first week of February &#8211; and this total includes cargoes moving north from Saudi Arabia that do not transit the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg" width="1456" height="708" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:708,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1895899,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22b0f3c0-bb16-49d2-8e06-afd49c359229_4800x2333.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h6><em><strong>(1) Based on speed of 12.5 knots. Number of days for one-way voyage only; (2) Data from Vortexa. (Chart: Scorpio Tankers Feb. 14 investor presentation)</strong></em> </h6><p><br>The southern Red Sea &#8220;is effectively closed&#8221; to product tankers, said Scorpio President Robert Bugbee on the call.</p><p>Unlike the case of container ships, where the rerouting rate effect seems to have peaked, the effect on product tanker rates has just begun, as it takes time for longer routes to translate into less capacity available for the next round of voyage fixtures.</p><p>As Bugbee put it: &#8220;Just because you put an obstacle in the way of a group going to a bar and they have to take a longer route, it doesn&#8217;t change the number of people standing at the bar waiting for drinks to begin with. It takes a little time.&#8221;</p><p>There is another big difference between the rate effect on container shipping and product tankers: The container market was oversupplied with ships when Red Sea disruptions hit. Container shipping spot-rate upside was off loss-making levels. In contrast, the product tanker market was already tight and boasting high rates when reroutings ensued. Red Sea upside is the icing on the cake for product tankers.</p><p>&#8220;We are running the company as if the Red Sea were to open tomorrow, and on that basis, we still think that the market will be very strong,&#8221; said Bugbee.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h4><strong>Crude tankers: Russian cargoes remain, Western cargoes divert</strong></h4><p>Ship-position data shows that most of the vessels now transiting the southern Red Sea are crude tankers &#8211; including numerous tankers loaded with Russian crude &#8211; and dry bulk vessels.</p><p>Shipbroker Gibson said of current Red Sea tanker trades: &#8220;Vessels with significant recent Russian trading history continue to transit en masse, both laden and in ballast. The majority of conventional tonnage continues to reroute via the Cape of Good Hope (COGH).&#8221;</p><p>Outside of Russian cargoes, &#8220;most crude tankers [are] avoiding the Red Sea,&#8221; said Gibson.</p><p>While the effect on crude tanker rates &#8220;has been muted so far, if the current situation continues for any significant period of time, the impact of COGH routing will accumulate, offering support to tanker rates.&#8221;</p><h4><strong>Dry bulk ships finally diverting from Bab-el-Mandeb Strait</strong></h4><p>Dry bulk carriers transiting the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait significantly outnumber crude tankers, although bulkers carrying U.S. export cargoes are no longer plying the route. Bulkers carrying U.S. grain and coal cargoes to Asia had previously diverted from the Panama Canal to the Suez route. Now they&#8217;re taking the Cape route.</p><p>Dry bulk vessels that do transit the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait continue to be attacked, particularly bulkers with registered U.K. ownership. The Lycavitos was targeted on Feb 15. The Rubymar was hit on Feb. 18; its crew were forced to abandon ship.</p><p>Transits of bulkers owned by U.S.-listed shipowners persisted for a surprisingly long time, but those have now been halted.</p><p>Petros Pappas, CEO of Star Bulk (NASDAQ: SBLK), addressed the Red Sea situation on a conference call on Feb. 13. Two of Star Bulk&#8217;s vessels were recently attacked by the Houthis: the Star Iris (carrying Brazilian corn to Iran) on Feb. 12 and the Star Nasia on Feb. 6 (the Nasia departed from Norfolk, Virginia, and was en route to India, implying it was loaded with U.S. coal).</p><p>&#8220;We had two cases of charters where we asked our charterers not go through the Suez Canal, but legally, we could not do that, because until that time [when the charters were agreed] we did not know about the attacks on the Eagle Bulk and Genco vessels,&#8221; said Pappas.</p><p>The Genco Picardy, owned by Geno Shipping &amp; Trading (NYSE: GNK), was struck on Jan. 17. The Gibraltar Eagle, owned by Eagle Bulk Shipping (NYSE: EGLE), was hit on Jan. 15.</p><p>&#8220;We were advised that we had to follow the charter party and send the vessels through the Suez,&#8221; said Pappas. &#8220;So, the first vessel [Star Nasia] passed and it was attacked three times. While that was happening, the second vessel was already passing through the Suez, so we couldn&#8217;t divert it. And it was attacked.</p><p>&#8220;Going forward, we will not be passing through the Suez Canal anymore, because we are obviously a target of the Houthis, being a public company registered in the U.S.&#8221;</p><h4><strong>How Red Sea crisis impacts US imports and exports</strong></h4><p>The change in trade flows since the Houthi attacks has been swift and far-reaching. &nbsp;</p><p>As of Feb. 16, ship-position data for all commercial vessels in the world bound for the U.S. or departing from the U.S. showed zero vessels passing through the southern Red Sea. The route transition &#8211; from a U.S. trade perspective &#8211; is now effectively complete.</p><p>U.S. supply chains have adjusted without any negative effects on the U.S. economy, despite earlier warnings to the contrary.</p><p>The specific consequences by shipping sector:</p><p><em>Container imports &#8211; </em>Diversions affected Asia-U.S. East/Gulf Coast containerized cargoes that previously used the Panama Canal and had rerouted to the Suez, as well as cargoes to East/Gulf Coast ports from India and other Asian countries that traditionally use the Suez. Spot freight prices are significantly higher than before the route diversions, but not to the extent that will cause goods price inflation. Spot rates are expected to decline as the year goes on. There have been delays, but nonetheless, monthly U.S. import volumes are rising. Containerized U.S. imports rose 7.9% in January versus December, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/gmjournalist/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply?r=9hzca&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">according to Descartes</a>.</p><p><em>LNG and LPG exports &#8211; </em>The U.S. is the world&#8217;s largest exporter of LNG and LPG. Diversions affected LNG and LPG cargoes to Asia that previously used the Panama Canal and had switched to the Suez. All U.S. LNG and LPG exports to Asia are now rounding the Cape. Voyage time is longer, but spot rates for both LNG and LPG ships have fallen since the Red Sea crisis began and are now below their five-year averages, according to data from Clarksons.</p><p><em>Crude oil exports &#8211; </em>U.S. crude exports to Asia are loaded aboard very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude), which have always used the Cape of Good Hope route, thus there is no disruption to U.S. exports. Meanwhile, the disruption of European crude imports from sources west of the Suez is a positive for American exporters: It could incentivize replacement cargoes to Europe from the U.S. Gulf.</p><p><em>Refined products exports </em>&#8211; The vast majority of U.S. refined products exports head to Europe and South America and do not transit the Suez, so no disruption effect. And, as on the crude side, Red Sea disruptions to Europe&#8217;s sourcing of diesel and other refined products from west of the Suez is a plus for U.S. products exports demand, due to replacement cargo potential.</p><p><em>Dry bulk &#8211; </em>The Red Sea crisis impacts U.S. grain and coal exports to Asia that first switched from the Panama Canal to the Suez Canal, and have subsequently switched to the Cape. Voyage time is longer. But overall, dry bulk freight costs are not elevated. According to Clarksons data, average spot rates for Panamax and Supramax bulkers &#8211; the vessel classes that carry U.S. grain and coal exports &#8211; are both down since the start of the Houthi attacks, and in line with the five-year average.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/as-us-military-polices-red-sea-us?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/p/as-us-military-polices-red-sea-us?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panama Canal added more reservations in January.

The problem is that there&#8217;s a lot more information than there used to be &#8211; and a good portion of it is biased and sensationalized.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a first-hand view on how the shipping information flow has dramatically changed since the supply chain crisis, and how those changes have created new challenges for those needing accurate information to guide their decisions.</p><h4><strong>Shipping coverage pre-supply chain crisis</strong></h4><p>Prior to the supply chain crisis, the general public had little interest in or awareness of the vast network of ships that delivered their retail products, energy and food across the seas. Most of the shipping news seen by the general public involved oil spills and oil-soaked birds. If a journalist told someone he covered shipping, the response was often: &#8220;You mean, like FedEx?&#8221;</p><p>The vast majority of shipping journalism was provided by specialized trade publications with expensive paywalls. The journalists who wrote for these publications knew the market and were overseen by editors who had years of experience covering shipping. The old-school &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; model helped to ensure accuracy.</p><p>There were only a small number of writers in the world covering ocean shipping back then. We&#8217;d sit side by side at shipping conferences in New York, Long Beach, Athens and Oslo, and simultaneously roll our eyes when panelists assured us, yet again, that &#8220;the rate recovery is just around the corner.&#8221; We&#8217;d catch up over drinks at conference cocktail parties and express our mutual amazement at the latest antics of Greek shipowner George Economou.</p><p>The audience for shipping journalism was likewise small in that era: Our readers were primarily ship operators, cargo shippers, institutional investors and the professionals who served the industry (lawyers, bankers, insurers, etc.)</p><h4><strong>Enter the supply chain crisis</strong></h4><p>The dissemination of shipping information today is vastly different, for three main reasons: the explosion of public interest in and awareness of ocean shipping sparked by the supply chain crisis; sweeping changes in the journalism industry due to the collapse of traditional revenue models, leading to the rise of digital journalism powered by social media and Google search; and the proliferation of opinion-driven information on social media from non-journalists.</p><p>Over the past decade, the demise of traditional journalism business models has led &#8211; particularly with the rise of non-paywalled digital journalism &#8211; to a scramble for pageviews, and the increasing use of pageviews as a performance metric.</p><p>The good news is that most of the traditional paywalled shipping publications continue to exist, and there are several non-paywalled and hybrid platforms putting out quality shipping journalism.</p><p>The challenge to the shipping journalist whose job security hinges on pageviews is to nonetheless put objective, accurate journalism first and pageviews second.</p><p>It can be done. I worked at one of the old-school paywalled maritime publications for 15 years, writing for a niche audience, and then more recently, for a non-paywalled digital publication for five years, writing for a much larger audience that included the general public &#8211; and I believe my non-paywalled, high-pageview content was as objective and accurate as my earlier niche, paywalled content.</p><p>The bad news for seekers of actionable information on shipping is that the Internet is now awash in questionable shipping content and it&#8217;s harder to find accurate market information amid all the noise.</p><h4><strong>Shipping goes mainstream</strong></h4><p>The supply chain crisis was an extreme and sensational event. Eyeball-grabbing headlines on &#8220;skyrocketing&#8221; and &#8220;stratospheric&#8221; freight rates were entirely accurate and justified at that time. There were, in fact, &#8220;massive&#8221; traffic jams of ships clogging America&#8217;s port system.</p><p>The story of the supply chain crisis connected with everyday Americans. They feared that retail shelves would go bare, Christmas would be canceled and prices would spike &#8211; and they were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>As a result, pageviews for shipping coverage surged to unprecedented heights. Google Trends data shows that interest in the search term &#8220;supply chain&#8221; rose to a historic peak in October 2021.

Public interest in ocean shipping was also boosted by the Ever Given grounding in the Suez Canal in March 2021, which coincided with the supply chain crisis.</p><p>This event became a surreal meme machine. There was everything from an Ever Given <a href="https://forevergiven.app/">dating app</a> to the highly popular <a href="https://twitter.com/AuroraIntel/status/1374664149096144896">Austin Powers parody</a>, an Ever Given <a href="https://x.com/sophiasgaler/status/1375798669711183882?s=20">sea shanty</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/VinayDokania/status/1376753411555663877/video/1">&#8220;ramp&#8221; video</a>, and endless variations on <a href="https://twitter.com/mauldin_laura/status/1375443312480563204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1375443312480563204%7Ctwgr%5E97bfba62db86f1e347076020d76df42213c01db5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indy100.com%2Fnews%2Fsuez-canal-ship-blocked-africa-memes-b1821520">the small-digger, big-ship meme</a>.</p><p>Shipping had officially gone mainstream.</p><p>And this attracted a whole new layer of media coverage, not from the traditional shipping journalists, but from generalists who had no prior background in ocean shipping.</p><h4><strong>&#8216;SME&#8217; interview pitches tied to supply chain disruptions</strong></h4><p>The surge in interest in shipping during the supply chain crisis and Ever Given grounding attracted the attention of businesses looking to use that newfound interest to promote themselves.</p><p>Many businesses, particularly tech startups focused on supply chain visibility, sought to place the quotes of their executives, acting as &#8220;subject matter experts&#8221; (SMEs), into the coverage that was suddenly garnering so many pageviews.</p><p>Public relations (PR) intermediaries pitched the availability of their client SMEs to any journalist who had published articles on the supply chain crisis. The PR reps were not from the firms that historically catered to shipping; they were mostly individual PR contractors. (At one stage of the supply chain crisis, I was receiving over a dozen pitches a day, the majority from PR reps pushing quotes from CEOs of startup companies I&#8217;d never heard of, to the point where I finally had to mark them all as spam and block the senders.)</p><p>Veteran ocean shipping journalists are very particular about who they interview for quotes, but writers who are green to the field cannot tell a legitimate shipping SME from someone attempting to use a news hook for brand exposure.</p><p>For a non-paywalled journalist who is focused on pageviews first and accurate, objective journalism second, the new ecosystem was mutually beneficial. The SME interview pitched by the PR contractor provided eyeball-grabbing quotes, the article got pageviews, the writer kept his or her job, the PR rep got paid and the SME&#8217;s company got brand publicity.</p><h4><strong>Coverage of Panama Canal, Houthi attacks</strong></h4><p>The point is: The supply chain crisis is now long gone, but this model of ocean shipping content creation is still very much alive. Each time a new shipping disruption emerges, the PR pitches ramp up again. &nbsp;</p><p>One example: the drought in Panama curtailing canal traffic. The Panama Canal Authority began warning of fallout in summer 2023, although transits of larger container ships in the Asia-U.S. trade were not curtailed until November. Traffic has continued to decline through this January.</p><p>But supply chains are flexible and trade has reflowed around the Panama Canal disruption. Canal restrictions have not caused a supply chain crisis. <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/gmjournalist/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply?r=9hzca&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">U.S. imports through January have actually risen</a> as canal transits have fallen.</p><p>You wouldn&#8217;t know this from the PR pitches sent to me in August. They highlighted &#8220;how the Panama Canal jam is putting cargo at risk,&#8221; the &#8220;looming potential shortages as the Panama Canal restrictions impact holiday stocks,&#8221; how &#8220;the historic drought is set to disrupt global supply chains&#8221; and &#8220;how clogged supply chains could ruin this holiday season.&#8221;</p><p>A more recent example: the Houthi attacks on ships transiting the Red Sea that caused vessels to detour around Africa&#8217;s Cape of Good Hope starting in late 2023 and continuing this year.</p><p>Cue the PR pitches in my inbox: &#8220;A domino effect on world trade is expected,&#8221; &#8220;Chaos in the Red Sea is rising,&#8221; attacks have raised &#8220;extreme concern for the flow of oil, food, grain and consumer goods,&#8221; the crisis will lead to &#8220;measurable costs to the consumer and supply chain,&#8221; diversions have &#8220;taken a hard toll on shippers globally,&#8221; &#8220;this is just the latest major disruption that supply chains have experienced and [our client] can speak &#8230; to what enterprises can do to mitigate shipping concerns and continued disruptions that threaten companies&#8217; bottom lines.&#8221;</p><p>And yet, on Feb. 8, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/gmjournalist/p/red-sea-crisis-reality-check-supply?r=9hzca&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Vincent Clerc, CEO of Maersk, the world&#8217;s second largest container liner operator, reported</a>: &#8220;We see no sign of congestion or bottlenecks or shifts in demand. The global supply chain remains fluid.&#8221; </p><h4><strong>Looking for the next crisis to cover</strong></h4><p>The PR machine is only part of the problem. Another is that pageviews can be addictive (and provide job security) and some journalists may miss the readership they enjoyed during the supply chain crisis.</p><p>Just as the Trump presidency was a boon for The New York Times and Washington Post, the supply chain crisis was an unusually strong period for maritime journalism.</p><p>It is only natural for journalists coming off such a period of story bounty to scan the horizon for the next crisis, and, swayed by recency bias, to look at each disruption (Ukraine/Russia war, Panama Canal drought, Houthi attacks) through the lens of what occurred during the pandemic.</p><p>The journalistic risk is that a yearning for the next supply chain crisis can lead to a tone of coverage that does not reflect market realities, which may actually warrant a less exciting story with a less punchy headline read by fewer people.</p><h4><strong>Social media and shipping stocks</strong></h4><p>Meanwhile, recent years have also seen a surge in shipping information (as well as misinformation and disinformation) from another source: non-journalists betting on shipping stocks and posting on social media.</p><p>Shipping equities rose to prominence in 2004-2008 during a supercycle created by China&#8217;s ascension in world trade. Interest in shipping stocks fell after the global financial crisis in 2009 and remained weak during the following decade.</p><p>Then came the pandemic and the rise of the retail shipping investor.</p><p>Lockdowns left people at home, sitting at their computers and trading stocks. The initial interest in shipping equities during the pandemic was in tanker stocks, particularly Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT), driven by the &#8220;floating storage&#8221; thesis (which turned out to be wrong).</p><p>Retail investors then switched to container shipping stocks, including container-ship lessor Danaos (NYSE: DAC) and, following its January 2021 IPO, Israeli liner operator Zim (NYSE: ZIM). Fortunes were made by investors smart enough to get out of these two names at the top.</p><p>With the rebound in retail interest in shipping stocks, social media is now flush with opinions on how world events will affect shipping rates and thus equity pricing.</p><p>It is a rule of thumb in ocean shipping that wars, disasters and other disruptions are positive for freight rates because they create fleet inefficiencies. Thus, it should come as no surprise that shareholders who want the price of their own shipping stocks to rise will highlight the most sensational, extreme scenario for any shipping disruption when they post on social media.</p><p>There&#8217;s nothing to say that people talking their own book on stocks are wrong, but when people putting out shipping information are talking their own book on stocks, it inherently raises the question: Are you getting accurate information? What is the motivation behind this post? (And there&#8217;s an interesting parallel here: Shipping disruptions are not just positive for shipping stock investor returns, they&#8217;re positive, as previously noted, for shipping journalists&#8217; job security.)</p><h4><strong>Accurate coverage more important than ever</strong></h4><p>Add it all up and it&#8217;s easier than ever to be led astray &#8211; at the very time when objective, accurate and actionable information on ocean shipping is becoming more important.</p><p>The countries of the world played nice with each other for the first two decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, to their mutual benefit. No longer.</p><p>There are wars in Europe and the Middle East, and the potential for future conflicts in Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and Guyana. There are ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/gmjournalist/p/china-trump-war-and-deglobalization?r=9hzca&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Donald Trump &#8211; who&#8217;s touting a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods</a> and badmouthing NATO &#8211; is leading in the polls.</p><p>The greater the geopolitical unrest and splintering of global trade, the more that ship operators, cargo interests and shipping investors will need accurate information on how disruptions affect freight rates and trade flows, and the more that generalist macro investors and inflation watchers will look to ocean shipping for signals on global trade flows and goods pricing.</p><p>So, the need for the right information is there, and growing. It&#8217;s just a matter of knowing where to find the right information.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Maersk, the world&#8217;s second-largest container line operator, spoke in-depth on the Red Sea crisis during a conference call on Feb. 8, providing the first detailed insider view on what is actually happening in the market.</p><p>For those expecting &#8220;Supply Chain Crisis 2.0,&#8221; it was a reality check.</p><p>&#8220;We are dealing with a situation that is fundamentally different than what we saw during COVID and will therefore play out very differently,&#8221; stressed Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc. </p><p>&#8220;This is in no way the type of bonanza we saw with the COVID situation. It&#8217;s really important for all of you to understand that.</p><p>&#8220;COVID disruptions occurred due to a sudden surge in demand that resulted in congestion and bottlenecks on the land side that clogged up the global supply chain. The Red Sea disruption, from a shipping perspective, is a rerouting of cargo along a longer route.</p><p>&#8220;We see no sign of congestion or bottlenecks or shifts in demand. The global supply chain remains fluid.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>&#8220;Demand and supply are steady. This is because there are levers today to absorb the impact without further disruptions, by using the capacity that was underemployed at the end of 2023, by accelerating the service speed that had slowed down during 2023, and by gradually plugging new tonnage into existing rotations,&#8221; explained Clerc.</p><h4><strong>&#8216;Just a matter of time&#8217; before overcapacity strikes</strong></h4><p>Vessel reroutings have increased global shipping capacity requirements by 6-7%, he said.</p><p>The use of previously underutilized capacity covers 2% of that gap, &#8220;and sailing the global fleet faster has so far cushioned most of the impact&#8221; of the remaining 4-5%.</p><p>Furthermore, &#8220;newbuilds will gradually phase in at 2-3% net growth per quarter and fill in the missing positions before the seasonal Q3 peak season and allow for a reduction of service speed. Therefore, it is just a matter of time. We estimate it will be a maximum of three quarters until the capacity issue is fully resolved.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg" width="1456" height="499" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:441915,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef4fd8d-c137-4a98-8c3a-230e5b0c2624_2400x822.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h6><em><strong>Maersk outlook on Red Sea impacts to supply-demand balance and rates. (Charts: Maersk investor presentation)</strong></em></h6><p></p><p>The threat to container line profits from overcapacity has not gone away, warned Clerc. </p><p>&#8220;We came into 2024 with a significant supply side challenge and that remains unchanged. The Red Sea disruption is absorbing some of the capacity temporarily. However, the structural imbalance will catch up to us during 2024 and will be exacerbated over time, irrespective of when the Red Sea situation is resolved.</p><p>&#8220;Regardless of the duration, we expect that new ship deliveries will eventually overwhelm the impact of Red Sea disruptions and rates will revert to pre-disruption levels.</p><p>&#8220;And if you look at the orderbook of ships that will be delivered in 2024, there are almost [as many] deliveries in 2025 &#8211; so, that is not good news.&#8221;</p><h4><strong>Liners face &#8216;immediate&#8217; hit when Suez transits resume</strong></h4><p>The revenue reversal will be quick and painful once the Red Sea crisis is resolved and container ships once again transit the Suez Canal.</p><p>Maersk finalized its annual Asia-Europe contract rates just before the Red Sea crisis pushed up spot rates. This year&#8217;s contract rates, which cover over 65% of Maersk&#8217;s volumes, suffered &#8220;a significant downward adjustment&#8221; versus the prior year&#8217;s rates, said Clerc.<br><br>Liners are recouping extra costs on voyages that go around the Cape of Good Hope via surcharges added to contract rates.</p><p>But Maersk CFO Patrick Jany noted that added revenues from these surcharges will disappear overnight as soon as Suez voyages resume, while costs will linger. &#8220;When [disruptions] stop, we cannot charge those surcharges and we will still have additional costs to unwind,&#8221; he said.</p><p>According to Clerc, &#8220;The contractual terms are such that the moment the ships sail through the Suez again, these [surcharges] will go away automatically. There will be an immediate adjustment &#8230; an extremely rapid adjustment compared to what you would normally see.&#8221;</p><h4><strong>&#8216;Ambiguous&#8217; whether Red Sea effect is positive</strong></h4><p>As a result of the surcharges &#8211; which began with the very first voyages around the Cape of Good Hope &#8211; Maersk is likely to &#8220;over-recover on costs at the beginning and under-recover on costs at the end [because] some of the costs will stay with us for longer,&#8221; said Clerc. </p><p>Asked which costs will be &#8220;stickiest,&#8221; he pointed to extra container equipment that Maersk has had to buy or lease, and extra ships it has had to charter.</p><p>He likened the looming cost hangover to the situation after the COVID-era boom. &#8220;We got the benefits on the freight rates from the COVID disruptions, but those disruptions are gone and our unit costs are still not back to 2019 levels. That&#8217;s why Q4 looked the way it did.&#8221;</p><p>Maersk reported a net loss of $456 million for Q4 2023, and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of minus-$537 million, considerably worse than the Bloomberg consensus for an EBIT loss of $454 million.</p><p>Red Sea disruptions had a minimal impact on Q4 2023 results and will begin to effect results in earnest this quarter. </p><p>&#8220;We will certainly have a better Q1 than we would have [due to disruptions],&#8221; said Jany. &#8220;It will help alleviate the losses we would have had &#8230; but whether we break even or not is another story.&#8221; He said Maersk should end Q1 &#8220;pretty close&#8221; to breakeven.</p><p>Maersk&#8217;s new full-year guidance further dispels the thesis of a Red Sea-driven earnings bonanza. It now expects full-year EBIT ranging from zero in the best-case scenario to a loss of $5 billion in the worst case. &#8220;The reality will probably be somewhere in between,&#8221; said Jany.</p><p>The midpoint of the guidance, at a loss of $2.5 billion, is far below the Bloomberg consensus for positive full-year EBIT of $841 million.</p><p>&#8220;Actually, it is still ambiguous today whether this situation seen as a whole is positive [for profits] or not &#8230; and whether the revenues we recoup will be enough to cover the costs that will be with us for a longer duration,&#8221; said Clerc.</p><p>Maersk&#8217;s Red Sea reality check sent liner shares tumbling. Maersk&#8217;s Copenhagen-listed shares plunged 15% on the day of the conference call in over quadruple average trading volume. Hapag-Lloyd&#8217;s Germany-listed shares fell 9%. Shares of Israeli carrier Zim (NYSE: ZIM) declined 8%.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share INSIDE SHIPPING&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share INSIDE SHIPPING</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Surprise January surge in US imports </h2><h4><em>Biggest jump in January imports vs. December in seven years</em></h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg" width="1456" height="696" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:696,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1456379,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F529e73bf-4649-436b-a74f-a26ba2860df8_2400x1148.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h6><em><strong>(Photo: Port of Los Angeles)</strong></em></h6><p></p><p>A popular narrative is that the drought in Panama, combined with lengthy diversions of container ships due to attacks in the Red Sea, will crimp U.S. imports.</p><p>Given the timing of Panama Canal constraints and Houthi attacks, this should be apparent in the January numbers &#8211; but there&#8217;s zero evidence of import shortfalls, according to data released by Descartes on Feb. 8.</p><p>To the contrary, imports jumped, driven by volumes to the West Coast from China.</p><p>According to Descartes, U.S. ports imported 2,273,125 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in January, up 7.9% versus December &#8211; the biggest December-versus-January gain in seven years.

Maersk expects global container demand to grow by 2.5-4.5% in 2024 versus 2023. </p><p>&#8220;The beginning of 2023 was marked by some destocking, especially in the U.S. That worked itself out in the third quarter, and we saw volumes in the second part of the year become stronger. We expect that to continue on a sequential basis, with [more] growth in 2024.</p><p>&#8220;Demand is very stable. Actually, demand is more stable than it usually is,&#8221; said Clerc.</p><p><em>For Greg Miller&#8217;s full archive of articles written for FreightWaves in 2019-2024, <a href="https://gregmiller.journoportfolio.com/">click here</a>.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share INSIDE SHIPPING&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://gmjournalist.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share INSIDE SHIPPING</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://gmjournalist.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading INSIDE SHIPPING!
