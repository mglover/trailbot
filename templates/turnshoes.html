<p>
Turnshoes are an ancient method of shoe construction.  Examples dating 
back at least 1000 years in archeological digs in Europe. In this style, 
the uppers are sewn  inside out to a thick, single-piece sole, and the 
finished shoe is then "turned" rightside out, hence the name.  The 
result is lightweight, flexible, attractive, and extremely comfortable.

They're well suited for use as house slippers, errands around town, 
or light hiking shoes.  They're also perfect for period re-enactments 
like SCA or Renaissance Faires.
