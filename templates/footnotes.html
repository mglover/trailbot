  I highly recommend "Stepping through Time: Archaeological Footwear 
  from Prehistoric Times until 1800", by Olaf Goubitz. This is my go-to 
  resource for period reproductions.

<dt id="welted">Welted Shoe Construction</dt>
<dd><p>
  Welted shoe construction became common in the the 18th century, 
  and remains popular today for sturdy, long-wearing results.  Cowboy 
  boots, hiking boots, and dress shoes all use welted soles.  The 
  upper is stitched on rightside out, sandwiched between a thick leather 
  insole and a thin strip of leather -- the welt.  The outsole -- 
  traditionally thick, compressed leather -- is stitched to the welt.

<dt id="lasts">Lasts</dt>
<dd><p>
  A last is a (traditionally) wooden or plastic form in the general 
  shape of the human foot, used for making shoes.  The last provides 
  a temporary attachment point and support for the shoe under 
  construction.
  </p><p>
  Lasts are also expensive, bulky, and you need a new pair for every 
  size and shape of shoe you want to make.
  </p><p>
  I don't use lasts in my shoemaking.  Instead, I work from a <a 
  href="{{url_for('molding')}}">mold</a> of the foot itself.  This takes 
  less time and expense, and lets me truly customize the shoe from the  
  ground up, no matter how unusually shaped your feet are.

<dt id="recipe">Secret Recipe</dt>
<dd><p>
  Heat the leather pieces you wish to wax in a warm oven (around 
  160F)
</p><p>
  Take equal parts by weight beeswax and raw linseed oil. Heat them 
  together in a double-boiler, mixing occasionally until fully melted.  
  Add about 1/10 part by volume of turpentine to the hot mixture.
</p><p>
  Take the hot leather out of the oven one piece at a time and brush the 
  hot mixture into it until no more will absorb.  Replace the piece 
  in the oven and continue on to the next piece.  Repeat until no more 
  wax will absorb.
