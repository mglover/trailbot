I'm going to write a web ui for trailbot here.  This page will load some JS thingy that will make requests using internal (+0807) numbers.  Some day it will let you authenticate a web session from yr phone so you have access to yr account over the web.

<ul>
<li> find a JS framework
<li> style this page
<li> ...a miracle occurs...
<li> done
</ul>
