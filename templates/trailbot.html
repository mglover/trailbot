<div class="didactic">
<p>Because I'm Old Skool, I hike with a flip phone.  Super-rugged, 
insane battery life, but a barely primitive web browser (and no data 
plan).  Great text messaging.

<p> This is 95% fine.  But I still find myself in town trying to
find wifi or a computer to do things that most people can do with
their smartphone.  

<p>TrailBot is learning to do those things.

<p>TrailBot knows how to:<ul>
  <li>fetch a <a href="#wx">weather report</a>,
  <li>give turn-by-turn <a href="#driving">driving directions</a>,
  <li>manage those <a href="#groups">group messages</a> you send to 
    friends and family on the road.
</ul>

<p>You can text TrailBot at:

<address class="big" >
    <a href="tel:+16815401024">681-540-1024</a>
</address>


<h3>First Things First</h3>
<p>The first word of your message is the <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>. 

If you text TrailBot the &lt;command&gt; 'help', like this:

<code>help</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">
   This is TrailBot. I understand these &lt;command&gt;s:
   <br>help, wx, status, sub, unsub, reg, unreg.
   <br>If you know someone's @handle, you can send them a message 
    by starting the message with their @handle

        visit oldskooltrailgoods.com/trailbot
</code>

<!--
You can text:
<code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>

And TrailBot will send back detailed help for &lt;command&gt;.
-->

<h3 id="loc">Locations</h3>

<p> TrailBot knows how to take descriptions of places on Earth 
(sorry @MajorTom) and figure out their exact locations.

<p> The &lt;command&gt;: 'where' tells TrailBot to find a location, 
like this:

<code>where empire state building</code>

<p>And TrailBot will respond:

<code class="b">
  Location Empire State Building
  <br>(full name: Empire State Building, 350, 5th Avenue, Manhattan 
   Community Board 5, Manhattan, New York County, City of New York, New 
   York, 10018, United States)
  <br>has coordinates 40.74844205 -73.98565890160751
</code>

<p>TrailBot (mostly) uses <a href="http://nominatim.org">Nominatim</a>, a free geolocation service covering the entire world. 

<p>TrailBot can look up these location formats on its own:
  City, ST (don't forget the comma!):
  <code>where Washington, DC,</code>
  latitude/longitude pairs (no comma!):
  <code>where 38.9413 -78.1911</code>
  ZIP codes:
  <code>where 83843</code>
  and, back to it's roots, AT shelternames (with the trail:at hint):
  <code>where trail:at Low Gap</code>

<h3> here and there</h3>

<p>If you're using TrailBot, it's likely that you're somewhere on the 
surface of Earth, and a good chance that you're going somewhere else.

<p>The &lt;command&gt;s 'here' and 'there' can keep track of those 
places 

<p>'here' tells TrailBot where you are, like this:

<code>here Leadville, CO</code>

<p>'there' tells TrailBot where you're going:

<code>there Jackson, WY</code>

<p>whereupon TrailBot will respond to the first request like this:
<code class="b">
Success. 'here' is set to: leadville (full name: Leadville, Lake 
County, Colorado, 80461, United States) coordinates: 39.2508229 -106.2925238 To forget 'here', say 'forget here'
</code>

<p>Now you can use 'here' and 'there' as locations.  So:

<code>where here</code>

will tell you that you're in Leadville. 
<p>Even better,<a href="#wx">weather reports</a> and <a 
href="#driving">driving directions</a>  will use 'here' 
and 'there' as you'd expect, so

<code>wx</code>

returns the weather for Leadville,

<code>wx there</code>

gives you the forecast in Jackson, and 

<code>drive</code>

<p> tells you how to get there.

<p> 'here' and 'there' are shortcuts for 'addr here' and 'addr there', 
and otherwise work just like any other saved address in your...


<h3>Address Book</h3>

<p>TrailBot can keep track of more than just here or there.

<p>The &lt;command&gt; 'addr' can give a name to any location

<p>Say 'addr name location', like this:

<code>addr vacation fisherman's wharf, san francisco</code>

<p>And TrailBot will reply:

<code class="b">
    Success. 'vacation' is set to:
    <br>fisherman's wharf, san francisco
    <br>(full name: Fisherman's Wharf of San Francisco, Taylor Street, 
        Port of San Francisco, San Francisco, CAL Fire Northern Region, 
        California, 94133, United States)
    <br>coordinates: 37.808332 -122.415715
    <br>
    <br>To forget 'vacation', just 'forget vacation'
</code>

<p>After that, you can use the word 'vacation' anywhere that TrailBot 
expects a location.  Like this:

<code>wx vacation</code>

<p>And TrailBot will tell you:

<code class="b">
  <br>2 Miles N San Francisco CA
  <br>4 Jun 22:06 pm PDT
  <br>Tonight: Mostly cloudy, with a low ~54. SW wind ~17 mph, with 
    gusts as high as 22 mph.  
  <br>
  <br>Mon: Partly sunny, with a high near 59. Breezy, with a SW wind 
    17-26 mph, with gusts as high as 32 mph.  
  [...]
</code>


<h4>Shared Locations</h4>

<p>The &lt;command&gt;s 'share' and 'unshare' let you control who else 
can see locations in your address book.  Locations are private unless 
you explicitly share them, like this:

<code>share vacation with @GroundControl</code>

and TrailBot says:

<code class="b">Success. Shared vacation with @GroundControl</code>

<p>@GroundControl can now ask:

<code>where @MajorTom.vacation</code>

and get back:

<code class="b">
Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco (full name: 
Fisherman's Wharf of San 
Francisco, Taylor Street, Port of San Francisco, San Francisco, CAL 
Fire Northern Region, California, 94133, United States) coordinates: 37.808332 -122.415715
</code>

<p>You can share a location with as many users as you want, or you can 
share a location with everyone, like this:

<code>share vacation</code>

<p>To stop sharing, tell TrailBot:

<code>unshare vacation</code>

to stop sharing with everyone.

<h4>Secret Menu: sharing 'here'</h4>

<p> If @MajorTom tells TrailBot:

<code>share here</code>

<p> anyone can ask:

<code>where @MajorTom</code>

and TrailBot will tell them:

<code class="b">
Cape Canaveral (full name: Cape Canaveral, Brevard County, Florida, 
United States) coordinates: 28.45077 -80.52662 
</code>

<h3 id="wx">Weather Reports</h2>

<p class="intro">The National Weather Service (NWS) providess 7 day 
weather forecasts in a machine readable format.  Not long after I 
started the AT, I was tired of having to find other hikers to ask for 
the weather forecast. Spending a few days off-trail to visit my brother, I 
hooked together the list of AT shelter locations with the NWS website. 
This is the first thing TrailBot learned how to do.

<p> The &lt;command&gt; for weather reports is 'wx'

<p>'wx' <a href="#loc">location</a> like this:

<code>wx Silver City, NM</code>

TrailBot will look up that location, request a report from the National 
Weather Service, and send you a condensed 3 day forecast:

<code class="b">
    Silver City, NM
    <br>
    30 May 19:15 pm MDT
    <br>
    Tonight: partly cloudy, with a low ~55. SW wend 7-17 mpg becoming 
    NW after midnight. Winds could cust as hight as 23 mph.
    <br>
    <br>Wed: Sunny, with a hight near 78. N NWt wind 6-11 mph 
    SW 16-21 mph in the morning. Winds could gust as high as 26 
    mph.
</code>

And so on for two more days. 


<h3 id="driving">Driving Directions (BETA)</h3>

<p class="intro">The <a href="http://project-osrm.org">Open Source 
Routing Machine (OSRM)</a> offers a free service providing road and trail 
routing instructions.  TrailBot uses OSRM to give  turn-by-turn 
directions for any two <a href="#loc">locations</a> it knows about.

<p> The &lt;command&gt; for driving directions is 'drive'

<p>Send 'drive <a href="#loc">locaction</a> to <a 
    href="#loc">location</a>', like this:

<code>drive Tulsa, OK to Denver, CO</code>

<p>TrailBot will think for a moment, and respond:

<code class="b">
    Turn directions courtesy OSRM
    <br>from Tulsa, OK
    <br>to Denver, CO
    <br>693 miles: 11hr, 53min
    <br>via I 70, US 40, I 70
    <br>
    <br>Start on South Boulder Avenue for 123 yards
    <br>Turn left on West 1st Street for 560 yards
    <br>[... and so on ...]
    <br>Reach Destination
</code>
</code> 
<h3 id="groups">Status Updates</h2>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p class="intro">Without TrailBot, there are two ways I can send a 
group texts 
  from my phone: send an MMS group message, but then everyone on the 
  list sees everyone else's responses to my updates (and their phone 
  numbers), or send a plain SMS text message to each member of group 
  individually. I like people's privacy too much for the first one, and 
  the second can take a long time and be unreliable, especially as 
  groups get bigger. 


<h4>Posting Status Updates</h4>

<p>To post updates on TrailBot, you have to first register a 
<a href="#handles">@handle</a>:

<code>reg @MajorTom</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">Success: @MajorTom registered"</code>

Now you can post your first update:

<code>status I'm stepping through the door</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">Success: update sent to 0 followers</code>

<b>NOTE:</b> status updates are limited to <a href="#460">460 
characters</a> in length


<p>Now, people can ask TrailBot about your latest status:

<code>status @MajorTom</code>

and TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">@MajorTom: I'm stepping through the door</code>

Or, most usefully, people can subscribe to receive your updates


<h4>Subscribing to Updates</h4>

If you know someone's <a href="#handles">@handle</a>, you can 
subscribe to their updates:

<code>sub @MajorTom</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">
    Success: subscribed to @MajorTom. Unsubscribe at any time by
    sending 'unsub @MajorTom'
</code>

Now whenever MajorTom posts an update, you'll get a message like this:

<code class="b">@MajorTom: I'm floating in the most peculiar way</code>

And like TrailBot says, you can stop receiving updates at any time:
<code>unsub @MajorTom</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">Success: unsubscribed from @MajorTom</code>


<h4>Direct Messages</h4>

<p>To send direct messages to someone, you need to register a 
<a href="#handles">@handle</a>:

<code>reg @GroundControl</code>

now you can use their @handle to send them a message or reply to their 
update:

<code>@MajorTom Take yr protein pills and put yr helmet on!</code>

and @MajorTom will receive:

<code class="b">
@GroundControl:Take yr protein pills and put yr helmet on!</code>


<h4 id="handles">Handles and registering</h4>

<p>A TrailBot @handle is a short, unique name that gets attached to any 
messages you send, just like on your favorite social media platform.  
Each @handle can belong to only one phone number, and each phone number 
can have only one @handle.

<p>TrailBot @handles are limited to 16 characters, letters and numbers 
only . TrailBot will use whatever Capitalization you register with, but differently capitalized versions of your handle still belong to you.  If someone else tries:

<code>reg @maJorTom</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">Handle '@maJorTom' already exists</code>

But if they send:

<code>status @MajOrTom</code>

TrailBot will say:

<code class="b">@MajorTom: Planet Earth is Blue</code>

<p>When you register a @handle, TrailBot will remember your phone 
number, your last status update and the phone numbers of your subscribers.

<p>You can always unregister your @handle:

<code>unreg @MajorTom</code>

TrailBot will immediately delete all of the information it has about 
you and say:

<code class="b">Success: @MajorTom unregistered</code>

(Twilio, the service that provides TrailBot's connection to the phone 
network, keeps logs of all messages for [a long time].  Text messages 
are 
not private, and there's nothing I can do...)

<h4 id="460">The 460 character limit</h4>

<p>SMS messages are sent in batches of 160 characters, known as a 
segments. This is why Twitter had their 140 character limit for a long 
time: they started out as a group text messaging app. Yes, I copied 
their idea.

<p>460 characters is three segments (160*3=480) minus space for an 
'@', a 16-character handle, a colon. a space, and one character left 
over for good luck.
