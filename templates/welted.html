<p>My hiking boots are made from 6oz top-grain vegetable tanned leather 
for the uppers, hand-waxed with a <a 
href="{{url_for('secret_recipe')}}">traditional blend</a> of waxes
and oils for long life and water resistance.  The uppers are welted to a 
13oz vegtan leather insole and stitch to a non-skid Vibram outsole.

</p><p>Welted shoe construction became common in the the 18th century, 
and 
remains popular today for sturdy, long-wearing results.  Cowboy 
boots, hiking boots, and dress shoes all use welted soles.  The 
upper is stitched on rightside out, sandwiched between a thick leather 
insole and a thin strip of leather -- the welt.  The outsole -- 
traditionally thick, compressed leather -- is stitched to the welt.
