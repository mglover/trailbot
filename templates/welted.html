<h2>Hiking Boots</h2>
<div class="section">

<img class="head" src={{static('before.jpg')}}>

<p>My hiking boots are made from 6oz top-grain vegetable tanned leather 
for the uppers, hand-waxed with a <a 
href="{{url_for('secret_recipe')}}">traditional blend</a> of waxes
and oils for long life and water resistance.  The uppers are welted to a 
13oz vegtan leather insole and stitch to a non-skid Vibram outsole.

</p><p>Welted shoe construction became common in the the 18th century, 
and 
remains popular today for sturdy, long-wearing results.  Cowboy 
boots, hiking boots, and dress shoes all use welted soles.  The 
upper is stitched on rightside out, sandwiched between a thick leather 
insole and a thin strip of leather -- the welt.  The outsole -- 
traditionally thick, compressed leather -- is stitched to the welt.

</p><p>
Prices for hiking boots vary depending on your exact needs, but most 
shoes cost between $600-700.

All of my shoes are custom made, based off of  a <a href="{{
